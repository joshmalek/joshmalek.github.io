### Projects

#### [cookbook.js](https://github.com/joshmalek/cookbook)

The idea for this project was to make a platform where a user could
easily save recipes to a graphic board, and add their own recipes to 
the board.  The site is currently using the Edamam API, allowing for 
recipe search by keyword.  The platform is built with React.js, with a
backend and user authentication being currently developed.
