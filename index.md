### Projects

#### [cookbook.js](https://github.com/joshmalek/cookbook)

The idea for this project was to make a platform where a user could
easily save recipes to a graphic board, and add their own recipes to 
the board.  The site is currently using the Edamam API, allowing for 
recipe search by keyword.  The platform is built with React.js, with a
backend and user authentication being currently developed.

#### [Discord Server Relay](https://github.com/joshmalek/discord-relay)

This project was designed as a template for a basic server relay.  A
server relay operates by having a normal Discord account in private server,
which has a script running to scrape all channel activity.  One bot account 
is created for each channel one would want to relay, andeasily be extended to 
however many bot accounts are required.  The unique feature of this program
is that it needs only one account in the private server, and is undetectable.  
The program was built with node.js, and uses the discord.js package.

#### [Steam Trade Bot](https://github.com/joshmalek/Steam-Trade-Bot)

This bot was built for the Steam network to trade virtual currency (CS:GO skins) autonomously and generate real-dollar profit. Bot will automatically accept all trade requests made from admin account. If the amount offered by customer is greater than the amount to trade away, trade is accepted. If a donation is made to bot account, trade is accepted. Bot will deny all other trade requests.  This guarantees (ignoring market shift) a stable profit over time.  The
system was built with node.js and uses a suite of Steam packages in npm.
